# WEBSITE-BLOCKER
Instead of using third-party applications to blocks certain website, we can develop our own custom application which will block websites of our choice and developing a website blocker in python is not so difficult too. Thatâ€™s what we going to do- develop a python script which will block the website we want.


How do we do it?


Every operating system has a hosts file. Location of the host file may be different for the different operating system. This host file is map hostname to IP address of the machine. In this host file, we going to list websites which we want to block.
